## Why Neurocraft?

[Neurocraft](http://neurocraft.co.uk) is a platform featuring peer-reviewed methodology for feature extraction and modelling of electrophysiological data. 

- **SOTA.** Powered by a wavelet coherence engine, Neurocraft is able to push the envelope with ultra-high temporal and frequency resolution of neuronal dynamics. All actions (e.g. layout, filter, drag) run in real-time.
- **Simple.** Easy to install and [get started](https://www.neurocraft.co.uk/#get_started). An UI that is centered around the visualization. Like Photoshopâ„¢ for brain networks.
- **Comprehensive.**  A wide variety of analytics and modelling offers thorough data exploration

## Install and use neurocraft

Download and [Install](https://neurocraft.github.io/users/install/) neurocraft on your computer. 

Get started with the [Quick Start](https://github.com/Neurognostics/neurocraft/wiki/quick-start/) and follow the [Tutorials](https://github.com/Neurognostics/neurocraft/wiki/Tutorials/). Load a sample [dataset](https://github.com/Neurognostics/neurocraft/wiki/Datasets) and start to play with the data.

If you run into any trouble or have questions consult our [forum](https://neurocraft.talkyard.net/).

## Latest releases (ðŸš¨ Warning: Unstable Prototype ðŸš¨)

**This is a prototype package currently under heavy development. It does not currently have stable releases, and as such will likely be modified significantly in BC-breaking ways until beta release (targeting early 2022), and can only be used with directly in MATLAB or as standalone MacOsX app via a MATLAB runtime enviroment (pre-packaged inside the installer). If you have suggestions on the API or use cases you'd like to be covered, please open a github issue. We'd love to hear thoughts and feedback.**

Current version is v0.1.0-alpha.

## Troubleshooting

If you want to report any issues or bugs, we encourage you to start a discussion at our dedicated [forum](https://neurocraft.talkyard.net/), prior to opening a github issue. We are a small team of devs that work a 9-5 job besides maintaining this project.

## Prototype Usage and Feedback

We'd love to hear from and work with early adopters to shape our designs. Please reach out with your ideas and suggestions by creating a post at our dedicated [forum](https://neurocraft.talkyard.net/) if you're interested in using this tooling for your project.

## Future Plans

We hope to sufficiently expand the library, harden APIs, and gather feedback to enable a beta release early 2022.
