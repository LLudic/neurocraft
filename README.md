# Neurocraft || The Microscale Neuroengineering Platform

[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/gephi/gephi/v0.9.2/total.svg)](https://github.com/Neurognostics/neurocraft/wiki/Releases)

[Neurocraft](http://neurocraft.co.uk) is a platform featuring peer-reviewed methodology for feature extraction and modelling of electrophysiological data. It runs on MATLAB and its beta release will also be available on Windows and Mac OS X as stand-alone applications.

- **SOTA** Powered by a wavelet coherence engine, Neurocraft is able to push the envelope with ultra-high temporal and frequency resolution of neuronal dynamics. All actions (e.g. layout, filter, drag) run in real-time.

- **Simple** Easy to install and [get started](https://www.neurocraft.co.uk/#get_started). An UI that is centered around the visualization. Like Photoshopâ„¢ for brain networks.

- **Comprehensive**  A wide variety of analytics and modelling offers thorough data exploration

## Developer Introduction

Neurocraft is developed in MATLAB and uses OpenGL for its visualization engine. Neorocraft follows a loosely-coupled, modular architecture philosophy. Neurocraft is split into modules. Plugins can reuse existing APIs, create new services and even replace a default implementation with a new one.

### Requirements

- Java JDK 8. Note: Neurocraft does not currently work with JDK newer than 8. Work needs to be done yet in order to support newer java versions.

- [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) version 3.2.2 or later
